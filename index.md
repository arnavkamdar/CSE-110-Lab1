Hi! I'm Arnav Kamdar, a second year computer science major. I have an ardent ***passion for programming*** and a ***zeal to learn more*** and have fun in the process! My work ethic and my career goals are defined first and foremost by happiness - I strive to find an environment and job where I feel fulfilled and am kept on my toes learning-wise. 
Here are some of my hobbies: 
- Hiking
- Rock Climbing
- Geeking out with friends about pretty much anything
- Exploring new places
- Building Legos!

## My Software Engineering Experience
Though I strive for a great work-life balance, I put a lot of effort into all the work I do. I've only been programming for 2 years, and have become fluent in a host of languages. This is the order I learned them in[^1]:
1. `Java`
2. `C`
3. `Python`
4. `ARM`
5. `PostGreSQL`
6. `JavaScript`
7. `Go`
8. `C++`
9. `NoSQL`

In addition, I have interned at two companies as a software engineer over the summer of 2023, namely [Insightly Analytics](https://www.hivel.ai/) (based in Hyderabad, India) and [Epifi Technologies](https://fi.money/) (based in Bangalore, India). These have been extremely fulfilling experiences and I learned more about software engineering and work culture through these experiences than I ever have in a college course.

> I'm hoping CSE 110 will change this, though! Looking forward to all the learning this quarter. [This](README.md) is the link to my CSE 110 repository's README file, and [this](screenshots/terminal) is the link to some of the work I did for Lab 1.

Here's a list of things I'm hoping to get out of CSE 110:
- [ ] Work with exceptional students who will soon become the face of the industry.
- [ ] Build strong connections with peers that can benefit me and them in the future.
- [ ] Gain a much stronger understanding of what software engineering is.
- [ ] Deliver a project worthy of standing out amongst my experiences.
- [ ] Learn to use `git` and other software engineering tools fluently.

Ultimately, I want to know how to amalgamate products that people need into their daily lives seamlessly.

[^1]: Something I'm particularly proud of is the fact that these took exponentially less time to learn each time, with the last ones taking just a few hours to get my footing with and a few more days to conquer. 
  While this is definitely common for all programmers and expected, I'm still very proud that I've done so.
